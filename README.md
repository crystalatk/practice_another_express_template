# Practice: Creating another Express Template Using Bootstrap

Continued practice into using express template engine es6. This time, a router was not usedr but all routes were created in the app file. Also, bootstrap was used for basic styling. This was done by creating a partial for the head of the html only and using that partial to insert bootstrap link. The partial was also used to insert an individual title into each page. This title was individually defined under each page's app.get in the app file.
